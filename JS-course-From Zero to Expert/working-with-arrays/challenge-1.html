      // Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

      // Julia and Kate 各一個陣列
      // adult: age >= 3
      // puppy: age < 3

      // Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:

      const dogsJulia = [3, 5, 2, 12, 7];
      const dogsKate = [4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

      const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
        // 1. create a shallow copy of Julia's array
        const juliaAfterRemoveCat = dogsJulia.slice();
        juliaAfterRemoveCat.splice(0, 1);
        juliaAfterRemoveCat.splice(-2);

        // 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
        const allDogs = juliaAfterRemoveCat.concat(dogsKate);

        allDogs.forEach(function (age, i) {
          if (age >= 3) {
            console.log(
              `Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${age} years old`
            );
          } else {
            console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is till a puppy 🐶`);
          }
        });
      };

      checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
      // 1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)

      // 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy 🐶")

      // 4. Run the function for both test datasets

      // HINT: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far 😉

      // TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
      // TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

      // GOOD LUCK 😀
